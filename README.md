# MMConfig
MagicMirror setup and config file. I am using a RP Zero W, so the setup needs some tuning.

setup-mirror.sh: this is a script based on the excellent tutorial found here: https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/1183/how-i-got-my-magic-mirror-working-on-a-raspberry-pi-0-zero/8
It simply automate all the setup and file creation.

config.js: This is my config file for my setup so far (pretty much the default sample)
